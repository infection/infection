- we need a way to easily tell if a file (given its pathname) has tests. Currently it is a bit annoying because it's a breakdown of directories + files so the lookup is a bit annoying.
- the coverage needs to be size efficient somehow (so split files like the current XML coverage report?)
- a way to identify that the coverage is out of date with either the source code or the tests
