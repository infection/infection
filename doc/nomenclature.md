### Tracer

A tool responsible for creating a bound, a [_trace_][trace], between a piece of source code and the
test source which executes it. The tracer can work one way, i.e. find the corresponding test(s) for
a given piece of source code. It may also work the other way around or both ways.


### Trace

Artifact produced by a tracer: provides the piece of source code and its associated tests.
