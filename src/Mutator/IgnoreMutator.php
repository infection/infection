 * The mutators implement the ignore + canMutator pattern. The downside of this pattern is that
 * it makes its public API more complex and easier to mess up since the caller needs to be careful
 * of checking if he should mutate before attempting to mutate.
 *
 * A better alternative would be to allow to blindly mutate and do this "ignore + should mutate"
 * check internally. We however do not do so because before actually mutating, there is a few
 * expansive steps (e.g. retrieving the tests methods). Hence the currently chosen pattern allows
 * better performance optimization in our case.
