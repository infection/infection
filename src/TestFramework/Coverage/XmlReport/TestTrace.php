/**
 * Impartial trace providing information regarding the tests but completely lacks any awareness of
 * its associated source files.
 *
 * TODO: FileMutationGenerator::generate() ends up having to rely on both SourceFileData & Trace due
 *  to the fact that a Trace right now only exposes a test-related API
 *  (`hasTests()`, `getAllTestsForMutation()`). Maybe a cleaner solution would be expose the
 *  associated source file API to `Trace` as well, i.e. moving up `SourceFileData::getSplFileInfo()`
 *  to `Trace`. This current class `TestsTrace` could then become a simple helper for `SourceFileData`
 *  instead of a full-pledge `Trace` implementation. And FileMutationGenerator as a result would
 *  also be simplified to not have to rely on SourceFileData which is `Trace` implementation and
 *  depend on `Trace` only.
