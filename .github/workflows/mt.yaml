# This build is to test the whole execute the PHPUnit tests & collect the coverage
# report and run infection.
# We are not interested in:
# - Running it on different systems (e.g. Windows, which was disabled because too slow)
# - Min/maxing the PHP version used: it can be any supported version
# - Using different dependencies than the locked ones
# - Using different code coverages
# All of those variants may be interesting but are better tested in more scoped
# tests like in ci.yaml.
